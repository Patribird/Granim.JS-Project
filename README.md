# Granim.JS-Project-
Library research project done in 2020 for my JavaScript class.

In 2020, when I was still attending Clover Park Technical College. This final project involved finding a library online and implementing it into a brand new website. The requirements for size of the website weren't crazy to make sure that we had enought time to troubleshoot and ask for help. This project is the result of about a few days of work. The result has a lot of good and some bad.

To start off with the good, the index page with the login screeen looks incredibly satisfying. It's my favorite part of the entire project. I remember when I came up with the idea for it, I had to temper my expectations because I wasn't sure how difficult it may be. It actually exceeded my expectations and I am in love with how it looks, even looking at it a year or two later!

For the bad, the second webpage was mostly thrown together in the interest of time. It's not horribly complex . Though this was because I wanted to meet the requirement of implementing the library in two seperate ways. There's certainly more work to be done if I choose to do so. Though, the website itself doesn't have a clear direciton at the present moment.

The purpose of this assignment was to allow us to read documentation and explore how one would implement something on their own. Then comes the troubleshooting aspect of using a library for a different purpose than what the author originally intended. It's truly a unique and enjoyable experience. This project was the first step in showing me that this is something I'd like to do for a living.

Thanks for checking it out!
