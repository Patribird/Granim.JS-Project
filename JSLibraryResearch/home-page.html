    <p class="welcome-message">
        This website was done for an assignment and a took while to finish.
        The goal of the assignment was to explore and implement a library on my own.
        I had a great time creating this website and it was super rewarding to 
        make Granim JS to work.
    </p>

    <br> 
    <p class="welcome-message"> 
        As all the pieces started to fall into place I let out 
        an audible sigh of relief. What a pain, but man it was so worth it.
    </p>

    <br> 
    <p class="welcome-message"> 
        Also, I found the logo online, and the name "Trivision"
        was something my friend came up with in a Discord call.
